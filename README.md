# COVID-19 Fake News Detection

Project for the Text Analytics exam 2022/2023 at University of Pisa.

Misinformation has always been present in society, however with the advent of technology its spread has been uncontrollable. As the world was facing the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, fake news increased dramatically. This resulting in an overall panic in the population of even bigger proportions than it should
have been. Fake news coming from the web and social media are, especially for people with lower levels of digital awareness, dangerous, and could create a distorted vision of reality. The study proposed in this project is the analysis and detection of such inaccurate information regarding the Coronavirus pandemic.
The data was gathered from the [COVID-19 Fake News Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/covid19-fake-news) repository from Kaggle, which contains a collection of 33 files made up of articles, tweets and claims.
